Why are certain types of work or activity more interesting to us than others? How do we objectively measure the interestingness of things? Because it may vary from person to person.  There are so many variables that influence how an individual may perceive something. I am tired of writing. This is so boring. I am doing this to get some sample content to do a Proof-Of-Concept for the 
Wordplex
 google extension which will publish a doc to a website page.



I need to put in some formatted content and maybe an image. A list , what else? Some indentation and different text 
types
.



This is a list of things

Carrots

Potatoes

Tomatoes

Mangos



A smaller heading

	My aim here is to provide some material for assessing the content conversion capabilities provided by the parser  we are going to be building. Let me stick in an image here now.



The image above is going to be useful in determining how the parser needs to handle it and if there will be any issues with it.



Adios
